## 🧠 How the App Works (Logic Overview)

- All notes are stored in an **array of objects**
- Each note contains:
  ```js
  { title: "Note title", description: "Note description" }
The app checks whether the user is:

Adding a new note

Editing an existing note
using an editIndex flag

Notes are saved and retrieved from LocalStorage

The UI is dynamically updated using JavaScript DOM manipulation

🧪 How to Run Locally
